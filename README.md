Hello. This is my homepage repository.

Let's make one thing clear from the start: Yes, I did not come up with the design of it entirely on my own.
Yes, I copied a couple of things from the internet.
But still - I tried to make it look unique and welcoming.

I also don't own the music that plays on pages, I picked them from my archive of tracker music because they did fit good in those pages.
